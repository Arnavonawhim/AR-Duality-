// Points: 10
//
// Q3: What planet is known as the "Red Planet"?
// Keywords: mars
// Answer: Mars is called the Red Planet.
// Hint: It looks red because of rusty iron on its surface.
// Points: 10
//
// Q4: What is the Moon?
// Keywords: satellite, orbit, earth
// Answer: The Moon is Earth's natural satellite that orbits around us.
// Hint: It lights up the night sky.
// Points: 10
//
// Q5: Do stars twinkle?
// Keywords: yes, atmosphere, air
// Answer: Yes! Stars appear to twinkle because of Earth's atmosphere.
// Hint: The air makes the starlight wobble.
// Points: 10
//
// ===========================================
// MEDIUM QUESTIONS (Ages 11-14)
// ===========================================
//
// Q1: What is a light-year?
// Keywords: distance, light, travels, year
// Answer: The distance light travels in one year (about 9.46 trillion kilometers).
// Hint: It's a distance, not a time!
// Points: 15
//
// Q2: What causes the phases of the Moon?
// Keywords: sun, light, orbit, position, shadow
// Answer: The Moon's changing position relative to Earth and the Sun changes how much of it we see lit up.
// Hint: Think about where the sunlight is hitting.
// Points: 15
//
// Q3: What is a black hole?
// Keywords: gravity, light, escape, collapse, star
// Answer: A region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
// Hint: It forms when a massive star collapses.
// Points: 15
//
// Q4: Name the gas giants in our solar system.
// Keywords: jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune
// Answer: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
// Hint: They're the big planets far from the Sun.
// Points: 15
//
// Q5: What is the asteroid belt?
// Keywords: mars, jupiter, rocks, objects
// Answer: A region between Mars and Jupiter filled with rocky objects and asteroids.
// Hint: It's between the 4th and 5th planets.
// Points: 15
//
// ===========================================
// HARD QUESTIONS (Ages 15-18)
// ===========================================
//
// Q1: Explain Kepler's First Law of planetary motion.
// Keywords: ellipse, elliptical, orbit, sun, focus
// Answer: Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths with the Sun at one focus.
// Hint: Orbits aren't perfect circles.
// Points: 20
//
// Q2: What is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation?
// Keywords: big bang, afterglow, radiation, early universe
// Answer: The thermal radiation left over from the early universe, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang.
// Hint: It's the "echo" of the Big Bang.
// Points: 20
//
// Q3: What is the Doppler effect and how does it apply to astronomy?
// Keywords: redshift, blueshift, wavelength, frequency, moving
// Answer: The change in wavelength of light from objects moving toward or away from us. Redshift indicates moving away; blueshift indicates approaching.
// Hint: Think about how an ambulance siren changes pitch.
// Points: 20
//
// Q4: What evidence supports the Big Bang theory?
// Keywords: expansion, cmb, microwave, background, redshift, abundance, elements
// Answer: Cosmic microwave background radiation, redshift of galaxies showing expansion, and the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
// Hint: Three main pieces of evidence.
// Points: 20
//
// Q5: What is dark matter and why do scientists think it exists?
// Keywords: gravity, invisible, mass, galaxies, rotation, gravitational
// Answer: Invisible matter that doesn't emit light but affects gravity. Scientists infer its existence from galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing.
// Hint: Galaxies rotate faster than visible matter can explain.
// Points: 20
