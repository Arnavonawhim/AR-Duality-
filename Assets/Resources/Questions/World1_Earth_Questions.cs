// Power Reward: Gravity Manipulation
//
// ===========================================
// EASY QUESTIONS (Ages 6-10)
// ===========================================
//
// Q1: What makes things fall down to the ground?
// Keywords: gravity, earth, pull
// Answer: Gravity pulls things down toward the Earth.
// Hint: Think about why a ball comes back down when you throw it up.
// Points: 10
//
// Q2: What do we call the force that pulls you down on a slide?
// Keywords: gravity
// Answer: Gravity!
// Hint: It starts with the letter G.
// Points: 10
//
// Q3: Why does a ball roll downhill?
// Keywords: gravity, pull, down
// Answer: Gravity pulls the ball down the hill.
// Hint: Something is pulling the ball toward the bottom.
// Points: 10
//
// Q4: What happens to a feather and a rock if you drop them?
// Keywords: fall, ground, drop
// Answer: They both fall down, but the rock falls faster because of air.
// Hint: Think about gravity and air.
// Points: 10
//
// Q5: Is the Moon pulled by Earth's gravity?
// Keywords: yes, gravity, pull, orbit
// Answer: Yes! The Moon is held by Earth's gravity.
// Hint: What keeps the Moon from floating away?
// Points: 10
//
// ===========================================
// MEDIUM QUESTIONS (Ages 11-14)
// ===========================================
//
// Q1: Who discovered the laws of gravity?
// Keywords: newton, isaac, sir
// Answer: Sir Isaac Newton discovered the laws of gravity.
// Hint: Legend says an apple fell on his head!
// Points: 15
//
// Q2: What is the formula for force in Newton's second law?
// Keywords: f=ma, force, mass, acceleration
// Answer: F = m × a (Force equals mass times acceleration)
// Hint: Force equals something times acceleration.
// Points: 15
//
// Q3: What is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth?
// Keywords: 9.8, 10, meters, second, squared
// Answer: About 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s²)
// Hint: It's close to 10.
// Points: 15
//
// Q4: What's the difference between mass and weight?
// Keywords: mass, matter, weight, force, gravity
// Answer: Mass is how much matter you have; weight is the force of gravity on that mass.
// Hint: Your mass stays the same on the Moon, but your weight changes.
// Points: 15
//
// Q5: What type of energy does a ball have at the top of a hill?
// Keywords: potential, stored, gravitational
// Answer: Gravitational potential energy.
// Hint: It's stored energy waiting to be released.
// Points: 15
//
// ===========================================
// HARD QUESTIONS (Ages 15-18)
// ===========================================
//
// Q1: State Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.
// Keywords: inversely, proportional, square, distance, masses
// Answer: Every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
// Hint: Think about how distance affects gravitational force.
// Points: 20
//
// Q2: What is Einstein's explanation of gravity in General Relativity?
// Keywords: spacetime, curvature, curve, warp, bend
// Answer: Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
// Hint: Einstein said space and time can bend.
// Points: 20
//
// Q3: Calculate the weight of a 50kg person on the Moon (g = 1.6 m/s²).
// Keywords: 80, newtons, weight
// Answer: 80 Newtons (50 kg × 1.6 m/s² = 80 N)
// Hint: Weight = mass × gravity
// Points: 20
//
// Q4: What is terminal velocity?
// Keywords: maximum, constant, air resistance, drag
// Answer: The constant maximum velocity an object reaches when air resistance equals gravitational force.
// Hint: When you stop accelerating while falling.
// Points: 20
//
// Q5: Explain why astronauts float in the International Space Station.
// Keywords: falling, orbit, freefall, microgravity
// Answer: They are in continuous freefall (orbit) around Earth, creating microgravity.
// Hint: They're not actually weightless - they're falling at the same rate as the station.
// Points: 20
